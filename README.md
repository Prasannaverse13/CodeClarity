# CodeClarity üß† - Your AI Code Review & Explanation Agent + Code Mentor

CodeClarity is a Next.js web application designed to help users understand and improve code snippets. It leverages AI models to provide detailed explanations, identify potential issues, suggest improvements, and offer deeper insights through an interactive code mentor.

## üöÄ How It Works

1.  **Input:** The user enters a code snippet into the enhanced text area on the left panel.
2.  **Explain Code (Google Gemini):**
    -   Clicking "Explain Code" triggers a request to the Next.js backend (Server Action implicitly via Genkit flow).
    -   The `explainCode` function in `src/ai/flows/explain-code.ts` orchestrates the process for Google Gemini model analysis.
    -   This flow uses `ai.generate()` from Genkit to interact with the configured Google Gemini model (e.g., `gemini-2.0-flash-exp`).
    -   A detailed system prompt instructs Gemini to analyze the code and return a structured JSON output.
    -   The structured analysis data is passed back to the frontend and displayed.
3.  **Ask the Code Mentor (Sensay Wisdom Engine):**
    -   The user can type a specific question about the entered code in the "Ask the Code Mentor" text area.
    -   Clicking "Ask Mentor" sends the code and the question to a Next.js API route (`/api/ask-sensay-expert`).
    -   This API route securely calls the Sensay Wisdom Engine API, interacting with a pre-trained AI Replica.
    -   The Sensay Replica processes the code and question, providing an expert-like answer.
    -   The answer is sent back to the frontend and displayed in a dedicated section.
4.  **UI Rendering:**
    -   The `CodeExplanationDisplay` component (`src/components/code-explanation-display.tsx`) renders Gemini's analysis.
    -   The `SensayExpertDisplay` component (`src/components/sensay-expert-display.tsx`) renders the Code Mentor's answer.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Running

1.  **Clone the repository.**
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following:
    ```env
    # For Google Gemini based code explanation
    GOOGLE_GENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_GOOGLE_GENAI_API_KEY_HERE

    # For Sensay Wisdom Engine "Ask an Expert" Code Mentor
    # This is your Organization Secret Key from Sensay.
    SENSAY_API_KEY=10043e0796fd093f8a22bc3ffc09d328d96eec5df8e3779e4b7217c7e184a5eb
    
    # CRUCIAL: Replace YOUR_SENSAY_REPLICA_ID_HERE with the actual ID 
    # you get from the Sensay platform AFTER creating and training your AI Replica.
    SENSAY_REPLICA_ID=YOUR_SENSAY_REPLICA_ID_HERE 
    
    # IMPORTANT: This USER_ID must correspond to a user you've created within
    # your Sensay organization, and this user must have access to the SENSAY_REPLICA_ID.
    # See "Training Your Sensay Code Mentor Replica" section below.
    SENSAY_USER_ID=default-codeclarity-user 
    
    SENSAY_API_VERSION=2025-03-25 
    ```
    *   **Google Gemini API Key:** Obtain one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
    *   **Sensay API Key & Replica ID:**
        *   `SENSAY_API_KEY`: This is your **Organization Secret Key** obtained from Sensay (e.g., after redeeming an invite code). The example key is provided; use your actual key.
        *   `SENSAY_REPLICA_ID`: **Crucial!** You MUST create an AI Replica on the Sensay platform ([https://sensay.io/](https://sensay.io/)), train it with relevant coding knowledge, and then use its unique ID here. The "Ask Mentor" feature will not work without a valid Replica ID that your `SENSAY_API_KEY` and `SENSAY_USER_ID` can access.
        *   `SENSAY_USER_ID`: This identifies the user interacting with the Sensay replica. **This user must be created within your Sensay organization via their API or platform, and the replica must be accessible to this user.** For initial setup, you might use a default ID, but ensure this user exists in Sensay and has permissions.
    *   *Note: Never commit your `.env` file or your API keys directly into your code.*

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
5.  Open [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002) (or the specified port) in your browser.

**(Optional) Genkit UI (for debugging Gemini flows):**
```bash
npm run genkit:dev
# or (with file watching)
npm run genkit:watch
```
Then navigate to `http://localhost:4000` (or the port specified by Genkit).

## üß† Training Your Sensay Code Mentor Replica
For the "Ask the Code Mentor" feature to be effective, you need to:
1.  **Access the Sensay Platform:** Go to [https://sensay.io/](https://sensay.io/).
2.  **Ensure your Organization & API Key are Active:** Your `SENSAY_API_KEY` is your Organization Secret.
3.  **Create a User (if needed):**
    *   As per Sensay's "Getting Started" guide, you typically need to create a user within your organization. You can do this via their API (`POST /v1/users`). Let's say you create a user with ID `default-codeclarity-user`. Set this ID as `SENSAY_USER_ID` in your `.env` file.
4.  **Create an AI Replica:**
    *   Create a new AI Replica via the Sensay platform or API (`POST /v1/replicas`).
    *   **Important:** When creating the replica, associate it with the `ownerID` corresponding to the `SENSAY_USER_ID` you created/are using.
5.  **Train this Replica:**
    *   Train this Replica with data relevant to coding, code review, software engineering best practices, and the style of expertise you want it to emulate. This might involve:
        -   Uploading documents (e.g., coding guidelines, API documentation).
        -   Providing example Q&A pairs related to code.
        -   Defining its personality and conversational style.
6.  **Obtain the Replica ID:**
    *   Once created, your Replica will have a unique UUID.
    *   Update `SENSAY_REPLICA_ID` in your `.env` file with this UUID.

Refer to the [Sensay Documentation](https://docs.sensay.io/) for detailed instructions on creating users, replicas, and training them. The "Getting Started" section of their documentation is particularly relevant for these initial setup steps. **A 401 Unauthorized error often means the API Key (Organization Secret), User ID, and Replica ID are not correctly associated or permissioned on the Sensay platform.**
