## üöÄ How It Works

1.  **Input:** The user enters a code snippet into the enhanced text area on the left panel.
2.  **Explain Code (Google Gemini):**
    -   Clicking "Explain Code" triggers a request to the Next.js backend (Server Action implicitly via Genkit flow).
    -   The `explainCode` function in `src/ai/flows/explain-code.ts` orchestrates the process for Google Gemini model analysis.
    -   This flow uses `ai.generate()` from Genkit to interact with the configured Google Gemini model (e.g., `gemini-2.0-flash-exp`).
    -   A detailed system prompt instructs Gemini to analyze the code and return a structured JSON output.
    -   The structured analysis data is passed back to the frontend and displayed.
3.  **Ask the Code Mentor (Sensay Wisdom Engine - If Configured):**
    -   The user can type a specific question about the entered code in the "Ask the Code Mentor" text area.
    -   Clicking "Ask Mentor" sends the code and the question to a Next.js API route (`/api/ask-sensay-expert`).
    -   This API route securely calls the Sensay Wisdom Engine API, interacting with a pre-trained AI Replica.
    -   The Sensay Replica processes the code and question, providing an expert-like answer.
    -   The answer is sent back to the frontend and displayed in a dedicated section.
4.  **UI Rendering:**
    -   The `CodeExplanationDisplay` component (`src/components/code-explanation-display.tsx`) renders Gemini's analysis.
    -   The `SensayExpertDisplay` component (`src/components/sensay-expert-display.tsx`) renders the Code Mentor's answer.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Running

1.  **Clone the repository.**
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following:
    ```env
    # For Google Gemini based code explanation
    # Obtain a valid API key from https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
    GOOGLE_GENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_GOOGLE_GENAI_API_KEY_HERE_OR_LEAVE_BLANK_IF_NOT_USING

    # --- Sensay Wisdom Engine "Ask an Expert" Code Mentor (Optional) ---
    # If you do not wish to use the Sensay Code Mentor, you can leave these blank
    # or remove them. The "Ask Mentor" feature will be gracefully disabled if these are not set correctly.

    # SENSAY_API_KEY is your Organization Secret Key from Sensay.
    # Example: SENSAY_API_KEY=e1cae7e85c39dc22aff0b7b154cf0795c355a2b3176dbf9945e0ec6cdecdb5dd
    SENSAY_API_KEY=YOUR_SENSAY_ORGANIZATION_SECRET_KEY_HERE
    
    # SENSAY_REPLICA_ID is the UUID of the AI Replica you create and train on the Sensay platform.
    # This is CRUCIAL for the "Ask Mentor" feature.
    # You will obtain this UUID AFTER successfully creating a Replica (see Step 2 in "Setting Up Your Sensay Code Mentor Replica" below).
    # Example: SENSAY_REPLICA_ID=cbb19521-47b2-4371-b907-40f174f954f8
    SENSAY_REPLICA_ID=YOUR_SENSAY_REPLICA_ID_HERE 
    
    # SENSAY_USER_ID must correspond to a user ID you've created within
    # your Sensay organization (associated with the SENSAY_API_KEY). This user
    # MUST have access to the SENSAY_REPLICA_ID (ideally, be its owner).
    # Example: SENSAY_USER_ID=default-codeclarity-user
    SENSAY_USER_ID=YOUR_SENSAY_USER_ID_HERE
    
    # Sensay API Version (Recommended)
    # Example: SENSAY_API_VERSION=2025-03-25
    SENSAY_API_VERSION=2025-03-25
    ```
    *   **`GOOGLE_GENAI_API_KEY`:** Obtain one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey). **This is required for the core code explanation feature.** If left as the placeholder `YOUR_GOOGLE_GENAI_API_KEY_HERE_OR_LEAVE_BLANK_IF_NOT_USING` or blank, Google AI features will not work.
    *   **Sensay Credentials (for "Ask Mentor" feature):**
        *   `SENSAY_API_KEY`: This is your **Organization Secret Key** obtained from Sensay (e.g., after redeeming an invite code). **Do not include `sensay_sk_` prefix unless explicitly part of the key Sensay provides directly.**
        *   `SENSAY_REPLICA_ID`: **CRUCIAL!** You MUST create an AI Replica on the Sensay platform ([https://sensay.io/](https://sensay.io/)), train it, and use its unique ID here. This ID is returned when you successfully create a replica via their API.
        *   `SENSAY_USER_ID`: **CRUCIAL!** This must be an ID of a user that exists within your Sensay organization and has permission to interact with the specified `SENSAY_REPLICA_ID`. See the "Setting Up Your Sensay Code Mentor Replica" section below.
    *   *Note: Never commit your `.env` file or your API keys directly into your code if the repository is public.*

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
5.  Open [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002) (or the specified port) in your browser.

**(Optional) Genkit UI (for debugging Gemini flows):**
```bash
npm run genkit:dev
# or (with file watching)
npm run genkit:watch
```
Then navigate to `http://localhost:4000` (or the port specified by Genkit).

## üß† Setting Up Your Sensay Code Mentor Replica (For "Ask Mentor" Feature)

For the "Ask the Code Mentor" feature to work, you **must** perform these setup steps on the Sensay platform using `curl` commands in your terminal. Replace placeholder values with your actual information.

**Your Details (from `.env` or previous interactions):**
*   Your Organization Secret Key (`SENSAY_API_KEY`): `e1cae7e85c39dc22aff0b7b154cf0795c355a2b3176dbf9945e0ec6cdecdb5dd` (Use your actual key)
*   Desired User ID for your app (`SENSAY_USER_ID`): `default-codeclarity-user` (You can choose another ID)
*   Your desired API Version (`SENSAY_API_VERSION`): `2025-03-25`

**Step 1: Create a User in Your Sensay Organization**

   If the user specified by `SENSAY_USER_ID` (e.g., `default-codeclarity-user`) does not already exist in your Sensay organization, you MUST create it.
   Run the following `curl` command in your terminal, replacing the placeholders:

   ```bash
   # Set your environment variables (or replace directly in the command)
   export ORGANIZATION_SECRET="YOUR_ACTUAL_SENSAY_API_KEY_FROM_ENV" 
   export USER_ID_TO_CREATE="default-codeclarity-user" # Or your desired SENSAY_USER_ID
   export API_VERSION="2025-03-25"

   curl -X POST https://api.sensay.io/v1/users \
     -H "X-ORGANIZATION-SECRET: $ORGANIZATION_SECRET" \
     -H "X-API-Version: $API_VERSION" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"id": "'"$USER_ID_TO_CREATE"'"}'
   ```
   *   **Verify the response.** It should confirm the user was created (e.g., `{"id": "default-codeclarity-user", "linkedAccounts": []}`). If it says the user already exists, that's fine.
   *   Make sure the `id` you use here matches the `SENSAY_USER_ID` in your `.env` file.

**Step 2: Create Your AI Replica Owned by This User**

   Now, create the AI Replica that will act as your Code Mentor. The `ownerID` of this replica **MUST** be the `SENSAY_USER_ID` you created or verified in Step 1.
   Run the following `curl` command. **Choose a unique `slug` for your replica if `codeclarity-code-mentor-v2` or `codeclarity-code-mentor` already exists (e.g., `codeclarity-code-mentor-myinitials`).**

   ```bash
   # Ensure $ORGANIZATION_SECRET, $USER_ID_TO_CREATE, and $API_VERSION are still set
   # from Step 1, where $USER_ID_TO_CREATE is your SENSAY_USER_ID.
   # Choose a NEW UNIQUE SLUG if you've run this before.
   export REPLICA_SLUG="codeclarity-mentor-$(date +%s)" # Example for a unique slug

   curl -X POST https://api.sensay.io/v1/replicas \
     -H "X-ORGANIZATION-SECRET: $ORGANIZATION_SECRET" \
     -H "X-API-Version: $API_VERSION" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "name": "CodeClarity Code Mentor",
       "shortDescription": "AI assistant for code understanding.",
       "greeting": "Hi! I am the CodeClarity Code Mentor. How can I help with your code?",
       "ownerID": "'"$USER_ID_TO_CREATE"'",  # CRITICAL: Links replica to your user
       "private": false,
       "slug": "'"$REPLICA_SLUG"'", # Use the unique slug
       "llm": { "provider": "openai", "model": "gpt-4o" } # Or your preferred LLM
     }'
   ```
   *   The response will include a `uuid`. **This `uuid` is your NEW `SENSAY_REPLICA_ID`.** 
   *   **IMMEDIATELY update your `.env` file with this new `SENSAY_REPLICA_ID`**. This is the most common point of failure.

**Step 3: Train this Replica:**
   Train this newly created Replica with data relevant to coding, code review, software engineering best practices, and the style of expertise you want it to emulate. This might involve:
    -   Uploading documents (e.g., coding guidelines, API documentation).
    -   Providing example Q&A pairs related to code.
    -   Defining its personality and conversational style.
   Refer to the "Training" section in the Sensay API documentation.

**Troubleshooting Sensay API Errors:**
*   **401 Unauthorized:**
    *   `SENSAY_API_KEY` is incorrect or not an Organization Secret.
    *   `SENSAY_USER_ID` does not exist in your Sensay organization.
    *   The Replica specified by `SENSAY_REPLICA_ID` is not owned by `SENSAY_USER_ID` or the user doesn't have permission.
*   **404 Not Found (Replica not found):**
    *   The `SENSAY_REPLICA_ID` in your `.env` file is incorrect or does not exist in your organization under the context of the `SENSAY_USER_ID` and `SENSAY_API_KEY`. Ensure you are using the `uuid` returned when you *successfully created the replica owned by your user*.
    *   Double-check for typos in the `SENSAY_REPLICA_ID`.

Refer to the [Sensay Documentation](https://docs.sensay.io/) for detailed instructions on these setup steps. The "Getting Started" and "Conceptual Model" sections are particularly relevant.

**How the project uses AI technologies:**

*   **Core Functionality (AI-Driven):** The primary purpose of CodeClarity is to leverage AI (Google Gemini) for code explanation and review. This is not a minor feature but the central value proposition.
*   **Genkit for AI Orchestration:** The project uses Genkit to define and manage the interaction with the Google Gemini model, including structuring prompts, handling responses, and managing potential errors. This demonstrates a sophisticated approach to integrating AI models.
*   **(Optional) Sensay Wisdom Engine for Enhanced Interaction:** The optional integration with Sensay aims to elevate the AI from a one-shot explainer to a conversational mentor with memory, showcasing an advanced use of AI for interactive learning and support.
*   **Structured AI Output:** The `explainCode` flow is designed to receive a structured JSON output from Gemini, which is then parsed and displayed in a user-friendly format. This is more advanced than simply displaying raw text output from an LLM.

**Project Completeness & Technical Implementation:**

*   **Repository Structure:** The project follows a standard Next.js structure, with clear separation for AI flows (`src/ai/flows`), components (`src/components`), API routes (`src/app/api`), and services (`src/services`).
*   **README:** This README provides comprehensive setup instructions, feature descriptions, and troubleshooting tips.
*   **Code Comments:** Key functions and complex logic (especially in AI flows and API routes) are commented to explain their purpose.
*   **Security Best Practices:** API keys are managed via environment variables (`.env`) and are not hardcoded. Backend API routes handle interactions with external AI services, preventing client-side exposure of keys.
*   **Robustness:** Error handling is implemented in AI flows and API interactions to gracefully manage issues like invalid API keys, network errors, or unexpected responses from AI services.
*   **Substantial Technical Implementation:** The project involves setting up Genkit, defining complex Zod schemas for AI input/output, crafting detailed system prompts, and integrating multiple UI components to create a functional application. This goes beyond simple sample code.
*   **Showcasing Next.js & Genkit:** The project effectively uses Next.js App Router, Server Components (implicitly via Genkit flows), and TypeScript. Genkit is used as the primary tool for AI interaction with Google Gemini.

**Is the solution an agent built with JavaScript/TypeScript and Genkit?**

*   Yes, the core AI explanation feature is an agent built with TypeScript (Next.js) and orchestrated using Genkit to interact with the Google Gemini model. The "Explain Code" functionality in `src/ai/flows/explain-code.ts` acts as an AI agent that receives code, processes it via an LLM, and returns a structured analysis.
*   The optional Sensay integration further enhances this by adding another layer of agent-like conversational capabilities.
